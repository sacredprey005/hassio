Autossh

Simple autossh addon. The addon creates a ssh keypair, and uses it to connect to to the given host. The public key can be found in the log after the first startup.

Remember to set GatewayPorts clientspecified in sshd-config if you would like to open ports on other interfaces than localhost.

IMPORTANT: If you set GatewayPorts yes, all forwarded ports will listen on all interfaces, 0.0.0.0. GatewayPorts clientspecified is preferable.
